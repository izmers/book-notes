**Book Notes** is a full-stack web application that allows users to **track books, personal notes, ratings, and reading history**.  
Users can **organize their collection by rating, recency, or title**, and **book cover images** are automatically fetched using the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers).
